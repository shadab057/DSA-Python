### Time Efficiency ###

Techniques measuring time
* Measuring time to execute 
* Counting operations involved
* Abstract notion of order of growth

> Problems with this approach

$ Measuring time to execute

* Different time for diffrent algotrith. ✅
* Time varies if implementation changes. ❌
* Different machines different time. ❌
* Does not work for extremely small input
* Time varies for diffrent inputs, but can't establish a relationship.❌

$ Counting Operattion 

* Different time for diffrent algotrith. ✅
* Time varies if implementation changes. ❌
* Different machines different time. ✅
* No clear defination of which operation to count.❌ 
* Time varies for diffrent inputs, but can't establish a relationship.✅


# Order of growth

* want to evaluate program's efficiency when input is very big .
* want to express the growth of program's run time as input size grows 
* want to input an upper bound on gowth - as tight as possible 
* do not need to be precise: "order of" not "exact" growth
* we will look at largest factors in run time ( which sectioin of the progarm will tkae the longest to run ?)
