Measuring order of growth: Big Oh Notation

* Big oh notation measures an upper bound on the asymptotic growth, often called order of growth.
  
* Big oh or O() is used to describe worst case
 - worst case occurs often and is the bottleneck when a program runs
 - Express rate of growth of program relative to the input size
 - Evaluate algorithm NOT machine or implementation

Time Complexity 

> So the idea is simple 

- n^2 + 2n + 2   
  n^2 + 2n 
  n^2 + n
  n^2

- n^2 + 100000n + 3^1000
- log(n) + n + 4
- 0.0001*n*log(n) + 300n
- 2n^30 + 3^n

> Types of orders of growth 
- constant 
- linear
- quadratic
- logarithmic
- n log n 
- exponential
